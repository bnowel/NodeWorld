      the iisnode section configures the behavior of the node.js IIS module
      setting values below are defaults

    * node_env - determines the environment (production, development, staging, ...) in which
      child node processes run; if nonempty, is propagated to the child node processes as their NODE_ENV
      environment variable; the default is the value of the IIS worker process'es NODE_ENV
      environment variable

    * nodeProcessCommandLine - command line starting the node executable; in shared
      hosting environments this setting would typically be locked at the machine scope.
      
    * nodeProcessCountPerApplication - number of node.exe processes that IIS will start per application;
      setting this value to 0 results in creating one node.exe process per each processor on the machine
      
    * maxConcurrentRequestsPerProcess - maximum number of reqeusts one node process can
      handle at a time
      
    * maxNamedPipeConnectionRetry - number of times IIS will retry to establish a named pipe connection with a
      node process in order to send a new HTTP request
      
    * namedPipeConnectionRetryDelay - delay in milliseconds between connection retries
    
    * maxNamedPipeConnectionPoolSize - maximum number of named pipe connections that will be kept in a connection pool;
      connection pooling helps improve the performance of applications that process a large number of short lived HTTP requests
      
    * maxNamedPipePooledConnectionAge - age of a pooled connection in milliseconds after which the connection is not reused for
      subsequent requests
    
    * asyncCompletionThreadCount - size of the IO thread pool maintained by the IIS module to process asynchronous IO; setting it
      to 0 (default) results in creating one thread per each processor on the machine
    
    * initialRequestBufferSize - initial size in bytes of a memory buffer allocated for a new HTTP request
    
    * maxRequestBufferSize - maximum size in bytes of a memory buffer allocated per request; this is a hard limit of
      the serialized form of HTTP request or response headers block
      
    * watchedFiles - semi-colon separated list of files that will be watched for changes; a change to a file causes the application to recycle;
      each entry consists of an optional directory name plus required file name which are relative to the directory where the main application entry point
      is located; wild cards are allowed in the file name portion only; for example: "*.js;node_modules\foo\lib\options.json;app_data\*.config.json"
      
    * uncFileChangesPollingInterval - applications are recycled when the underlying *.js file is modified; if the file resides
      on a UNC share, the only reliable way to detect such modifications is to periodically poll for them; this setting
      controls the polling interval
      
    * gracefulShutdownTimeout - when a node.js file is modified, all node processes handling running this application are recycled;
      this setting controls the time (in milliseconds) given for currently active requests to gracefully finish before the
      process is terminated; during this time, all new requests are already dispatched to a new node process based on the fresh version
      of the application
    
    * loggingEnabled - controls whether stdout and stderr streams from node processes are captured and made available over HTTP
    
    * logDirectoryNameSuffix - suffix of the directory name that will store files with stdout and stderr captures; directly name is created
      by appending this suffix to the file name of the node.js application; individual log files are stored in that directory, one per node
      process (in files of the form x.txt, where x is between 0 and nodeProcessCountPerApplication - 1); given a node.js application at
      http://localhost/node/hello.js, log files would by default be stored at http://localhost/node/hello.js.logs/0.txt (thrugh 3.txt);
      SECURITY NOTE: if log files contain sensitive information, this setting should be modified to contain enough entropy to be considered
      cryptographically secure; in most situations, a GUID is sufficient
      
    * debuggingEnabled - controls whether the built-in debugger is available
      
    * debuggerPortRange - range of TCP ports that can be used for communication between the node-inspector debugger and the debugee; iisnode
      will round robin through this port range for subsequent debugging sessions and pick the next available (free) port to use from the range
      
    * debuggerPathSegment - URL path segment used to access the built-in node-inspector debugger; given a node.js application at
      http://foo.com/bar/baz.js, the debugger can be accessed at http://foo.com/bar/baz.js/{debuggerPathSegment}, by default
      http://foo.com/bar/baz.js/debug
    
    * maxLogFileSizeInKB - maximum size of a log file in KB; once a log file exceeds this limit it is truncated back to empty
    
    * appendToExistingLog - determines whether pre-existing log files are appended to or created fresh when a node process with a given ordinal
      number starts; appending may be useful to diagnose unorderly node process terminations or recycling
      
    * logFileFlushInterval - interval in milliseconds for flushing logs to the log files
    
    * devErrorsEnabled - controls how much information is sent back in the HTTP response to the browser when an error occurrs in iisnode;
      when true, error conditions in iisnode result in HTTP 200 response with the body containing error details; when false,
      iisnode will return generic HTTP 5xx responses
      
    * flushResponse - controls whether each HTTP response body chunk is immediately flushed by iisnode; flushing each body chunk incurs
      CPU cost but may improve latency in streaming scenarios
      
    * enableXFF - controls whether iisnode adds or modifies the X-Forwarded-For request HTTP header with the IP address of the remote host
    
    * promoteServerVars - comma delimited list of IIS server variables that will be propagated to the node.exe process in the form of
      x-iisnode-<server_variable_name> HTTP request headers; for a list of IIS server variables available see
      http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms524602(v=vs.90).aspx; for example "AUTH_USER,AUTH_TYPE"
